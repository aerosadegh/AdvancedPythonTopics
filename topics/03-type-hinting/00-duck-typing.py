# In Python, certain types are compatible even though they arenâ€™t subclasses of each other. 
# For example, int objects are valid whenever float objects are expected. 
# Mypy supports this idiom via duck type compatibility. 
# This is supported for a small set of built-in types:
"""
`int` is duck type compatible with `float` and `complex`.

`float` is duck type compatible with `complex`.
