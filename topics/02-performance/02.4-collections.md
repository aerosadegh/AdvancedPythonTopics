# NamedTuple vs dataclass

## Implementation

In **`Dataclass` all implementation is written in Python**, whereas in `NamedTuple`, all of these behaviors come for free because `NamedTuple` inherits from `tuple`. And because the **`tuple` structure is written in C**, standard methods are faster in `NamedTuple` (hash, comparing and etc).

Note also that **`Dataclass` is based on `dict`** whereas **`NamedTuple` is based on `tuple`**. Thus, you have advantages and disadvantages of using these structures. For example, space usage is less with a `NamedTuple`, but time access is faster with a `Dataclass`.

### In which cases namedtuple is still a better choice?

When your data structure needs to/can be **immutable, hashable, iterable, unpackable, comparable then you can use `NamedTuple`**. If you need something **more complicated, for example, a possibility of inheritance** for your data structure then use `Dataclass`.

## type or value?

 When you compare named tuples, the names are ignored: two named tuples are equal if they contain the same values in the same order, even if they have different class names or field names:

```python
>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> A = namedtuple('A', ())
>>> B = namedtuple('B', ())
>>> a = A()
>>> b = B()
>>> a == b
True
```

`Dataclasse` instances, on the other hand, will only be considered equal if they are of the same type. I pretty much always want the latter behaviour: I expect things of different types to be distinct.

```python
>>> from dataclasses import dataclass
>>> @dataclass
... class A:
...     pass
...
>>> @dataclass
... class B:
...     pass
...
>>> a = A()
>>> b = B()
>>> a == b
False
```
